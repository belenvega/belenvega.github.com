        <p>The first version of my design composition is very simple; only two typefaces and three colors are used. The typefaces I used are Helvetica and Lobster, which is from Google Fonts. The color scheme so far includes white, black, and a kind of coral shade. The website is layed out in a classic website template, in which the logo or title of the website is placed in the upperleft corner with the horizontal menu navigation. The photos, which also serve as buttons, are placed in a simple grid in the middle right of the page. I have a little space on the left side of the page, where the "add" button is, because I would like to include a vertical side-bar navigation as well, but on other pages of the website. </p>

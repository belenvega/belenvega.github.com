        <p>Since the first version, I have changed the layout and color scheme. Instead of a grid layout with columns and rows, I decided to change it to a single row so that the images (that also act as buttons) take up more screen space, and the user would have to scroll down the page to see what more the website has to offer. I have not only added more colors, but also two more pages. One page is an example of what the website would look like if the user clicked on one of the images from the first page, in this case it's the breakfast page. For the breakfast page I'm keeping the grid layout, I think it looks better and works better with the content. I added the vertical side-bar navigation, so the user doesn't have to go the previous page to go on the lunch page or the desserts page. The other page I added is an example what the website will look like for a specific recipe.</p>

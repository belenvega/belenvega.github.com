        <p>What I was mostly able to develop in these initial sketches are the designs and concepts for the recipes section of the website, because within it are subsections, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks or vegan, gluten-free, and I had to figure out how I wanted to organize and arrange those subsections.</p>
        <p>I also started thinking about the user interactions the website will offer. Ideas include what will happen when the cursor hovers over an image; I like the idea of the image slightly zooming in, or maybe the image becoming transparent so that the text stands out, letting the user know that they can click on the image to take them to another page.</p>
        <div id="myImage">
            <img src="images/sketchfour.JPG" alt="sketch four" id="photo">
        </div>
        <p>What I need to further think about and develop is the food log page. I didnâ€™t realize how much I wanted to include in the food log and finding a way to organize it all in a cohesive and neat way is proving to be difficult.</p>

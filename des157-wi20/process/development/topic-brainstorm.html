            <h1>Personal Brainstorming</h1>

            <p>From the brainstorming process I was able to come up with a general idea of what I want to create for my final project. First, I had to reflect on the broad topic of health and write down my immediate thoughts on it; I instantly thought about personal health, such as: physical, mental, and emotional, and consider what stems from those.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, I want to design something that I would want to personally use and I think could benefit others. My idea is to create an online personal health journal, where a user can keep track of their physical health, like how much water they drink, what they eat, their workouts. I'm considering incorporating an emotional and mental health section too, possibly a section for journaling.</p>
